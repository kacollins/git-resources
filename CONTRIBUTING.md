### Here's how to contribute:
* Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. <a href="https://github.com/signup">Sign up here</a>.
* Fork the repository (see GitHub's help guide <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">here</a>).
  * Click the Fork button in the upper right corner of the screen.
  * This will copy the repo to your account and you will then be in your copy of the repository.
  * If you would like to make changes to markdown files and code in a terminal of your choice outside of GitHub, download Git Bash here: https://git-scm.com/download/win
* **Make some changes.**
  * Open a markdown file (this one or readme.md) and click the pencil icon to edit it.
  * Add or change some text (see GitHub's guide to formatting and syntax <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">here</a>).
  * Click "Preview changes" to check your work.
  * Enter a short commit message in the textbox under the "Commit changes" heading.
  * Click the "Commit changes" button.
* **Changing a Commit Message**
  * If a commit message needs to be modified, you can amend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to GitHub. You can also     change a commit message to add missing information (see GitHub's help guide <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message">here</a>).
